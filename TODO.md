23. ~~Build human-oriented phrase indices for reference while studying~~
24. ~~Handle numbers like "three and a half" and fractions~~
25. ~~Add frequency count to word/phrase index entries~~ 
26. ~~Generate round 4 (quotes)~~
27. ~~Extract all numbers from the text (and build cram cards from them)~~
